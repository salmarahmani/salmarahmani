🚀 Hi! I'm Salma Rahmani, a computer engineering student deeply passionate about software development. 
I delve into various languages like Python, C, C++, and C#, and I love tackling both basic and complex projects. 
Whether it's crafting efficient algorithms or building robust software solutions, I'm always eager to dive in and explore new ideas. 
As a computer engineering student, I'm constantly learning and experimenting with different programming languages and technologies. 
These projects reflect my ongoing exploration and growth in the field. 
🌱 As I continue to grow in my journey, I look forward to sharing my progress and contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
